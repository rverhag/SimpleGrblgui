# SimpleGrblgui
A very basic gui for Grbl v1.1f. Written in C# for .Net 4.5

This interface is only to be used by people who wants a very basic gui for controlling GRBL from a Windows OS.

No fancy screens, menus, buttons or whatsoever. Just plug in and go..... almost

To get started you'll need grbl v1.1f(2017-08-01) flashed on an Arduino and Visual studio 2017 to get things compiled (or use the exe,  found here https://github.com/rverhag/SimpleGrblgui/tree/master/SimpleGrblGui/bin/Release , at your own risk)

Maybe you'll need to tweak the configfile a bit and change the comport to the right one.



Thanks to all the people who has provided insights, sourcecode, tips and tricks during development.

Thanks for the WpfCap-repository
https://github.com/chris-evans/WpfCap

And thanks to everybody involved in the Helixtoolkit project
https://github.com/helix-toolkit
for making it possible to create a 3D representation from the gcode.

Special thanks to Sonny Jeon (chamnit) for all his Grbl-work https://github.com/gnea/grbl. Without his work, this gui had no meaning
